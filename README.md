## Approach
1. **Planning & Structure**
   - Designed the quiz to display one question at a time with multiple answer options.  
   - Kept the UI clean and responsive for better usability.  

2. **Development**
   - Used **HTML** for structure and **CSS** for styling.  
   - Implemented **JavaScript** to:
     - Display questions dynamically.  
     - Handle user interactions (selecting answers).  
     - Keep track of the score.  
     - Show the final result at the end.  

3. **Testing**
   - Tested across different browsers to ensure compatibility.  
   - Debugged logic errors in score calculation and option highlighting.  


## Challenges Faced
- Managing **question navigation** (next/previous logic).  
- Preventing multiple selections for the same question.  
- Handling edge cases (e.g., no option selected, quiz restart).  
- Making the UI **responsive across mobile and desktop**.  

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
